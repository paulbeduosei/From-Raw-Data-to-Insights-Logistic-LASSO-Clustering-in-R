🚀 Just wrapped up an in-depth data exploration and modeling project applying logistic regression, LASSO (via glmnet), and multinomial classification on datasets like body, mtcars, and iris.

📊 I used this opportunity to test:

Feature selection with LASSO for predicting binary outcomes like gender.
Model comparison and performance analysis using multiple thresholds.
Odds ratio interpretation with logistic models on car transmission types.
Multinomial logistic regression for species classification (Iris dataset).
Clustering potential with gclus to evaluate correlation patterns.
🔍 Key insights:

LASSO helped identify the most predictive body measurements (e.g., Elbow Diameter, Forearm Girth) in classifying gender.
Adjusting thresholds drastically influenced classification outcomes and trade-offs between false positives and false negatives.
Multinomial models revealed how flower dimensions strongly predict species even in complex, multi-class problems.

❓ Questions this analysis answered:

Which body metrics best predict gender using LASSO?
How does weight, mpg, and horsepower affect car transmission type?
Can flower characteristics accurately classify species?
How do threshold choices affect model performance?
